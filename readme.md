This project is developed in Python. Main objective is to predict the headmovement of the Virtual Reality user when the user is using the head mounted display. We aim to predict the motion ahead of 100ms for now. In future we are looking to improve this model.We used pyrenn, a recurrent neural network library which helps in directly using the recurrent neural net structure.
